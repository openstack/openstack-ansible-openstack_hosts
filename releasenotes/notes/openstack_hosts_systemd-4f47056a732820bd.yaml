    It is now possible to create and manage third-party services,
    mount points and networks on hosts managed by OpenStack-Ansible.
    This also inlcudes networks, that are required for OpenStack-Ansible
    installation, like br-mgmt or br-storage.
    In order to configure specific resources on selected set of hosts,
    usage of group_vars or host_vars is appreciated.

    Added new varaibles that allow users to configure extra systemd
    services, networks or mounts on openstack hosts. While services and
    mounts can be configured on any targeted hosts, networks will be created
    only on bare metal nodes. In order to configure extra networks in
    containers please reffer to ``openstack_user_config.yml`` documentation.
    A list of new variables that were added:

      * openstack_hosts_systemd_mounts
      * openstack_hosts_systemd_networkd_devices
      * openstack_hosts_systemd_networkd_networks
      * openstack_hosts_systemd_networkd_prefix
      * openstack_hosts_systemd_services
      * openstack_hosts_systemd_slice
