features:
  - |
    Added key ``params`` to the variable ``openstack_host_specific_kernel_modules``
    which allows to supply module parameters as a simple string.
upgrade:
  - |
    Kernel modules loaded by OpenStack-Ansible will be defined for load in their own
    files under ``/etc/modules-load.d/``. Prior paths managed by OpenStack-Ansible
    like ``/etc/modules-load.d/openstack-ansible.conf`` for EL systems or
    ``/etc/modules`` for DEB systems will be cleaned out from managed modules during
    upgrade.
