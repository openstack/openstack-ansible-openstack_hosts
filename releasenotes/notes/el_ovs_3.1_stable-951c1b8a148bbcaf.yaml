    CentOS/Rocky linux deployments will get major update of OVS version
    from 2.17 to 3.1 and OVN from 22.12 to 23.03.
    RDO has stopped building packages for previous OVS/OVN versions which
    means they will not recieve any upstream bugfixes or security patches.

    If you still want to preserve old versions of OVS/OVN, you can define
    a following variable:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      openstack_hosts_package_repos:
        - name: rdo-deps
          file: rdo-deps
          description: rdo-deps
          baseurl: "{{ openstack_hosts_rdo_deps_url }}"
          gpgcheck: no
          module_hotfixes: yes
          exclude:
            - '*rdo-openvswitch*3.1*'
            - '*rdo-ovn*3.1*'
