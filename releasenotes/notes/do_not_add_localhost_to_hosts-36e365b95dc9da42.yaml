    After adding ``localhost`` to inventory explicitly this resulted in potential
    FQDN change due to adding a record for localhost into managed block inside
    ``/etc/hosts`` file.
    This is now fixed and record for ``127.0.0.1`` will be removed from managed
    by Ansible blocks inside /etc/hosts file.
